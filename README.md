# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans. The client is anyone who needs financial advice. They solve issues like savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. 

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I did a good job addressing the need for a hashing algorithm. This is important because financial information needs to be secure. This makes the companyu more valuable because it gives an extra element of trust. 

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I feel like genereating the Dependency-Check was very helpful because I did not know how to find common code vulnerabilities before this class.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I added layers of security by removing additional inputs, and by adding a hash.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To check the code I ran it and looked at the website it generated locally.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used a lot of stack overflow and other helpful websites like geeks for geeks.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I probably would show my ability to understand how to apply hashing algorithms.
